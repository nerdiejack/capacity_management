    "You just became the new IT Operations Manager of the MyWebshop Company. Unfortunately, MyWebshop has some stability issues as of late. You hypothesise that part of the stability issues are caused by capacity constraints. You petition the CIO to introduce a clear Capacity Management process to validate this hypothesis. The CIO agrees and arranges priority and budget. The architect provides you with the solution architecture (shown below) and your engineers already identified the key usage, utilisation and consumption metrics that drive the IT solution. All the data you need is provided in the csv files and the assignment guide is found below (with the actions marked with bullet points). \n",
